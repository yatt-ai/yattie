## About

**BETA** - *YATTIE is just getting started - please report any and all bugs you find. Likewise, contributions to the code to fix issues are always appreciated!*

YATTIE exists to help make tester's lives easier.  Ideally, it should remove friction from the exploratory process - everywhere from gathering evidence to submitting reports.

Our view is that testing is an art as varied and complex as those who undertake it.  So our goal is to create a flexible, extensible toolset to raise the bar for what each member of the testing community can accomplish.

If you have an idea about how we can better meet that goal, please let us know by [requesting a feature](https://github.com/dacoaster/yattie/labels/enhancement) or, better yet, [put in a pull request!](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
